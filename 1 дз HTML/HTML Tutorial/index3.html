    <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
    <p>
        <span class="abbreviation">Hypertext Markup Language</span>
        <span class="abbreviation abr">(HTML)</span>is the standard markup 
        language for creating web pages and web applications.
    </p>
    <p>
        Web browsers receive <span class="abbreviation abr">HTML</span> 
        documents from a web server or from local 
        storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. 
        <span class="abbreviation abr">HTML</span> describes the structure of
        a web page semantically and originally included cues for the 
        appearance of the document.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="abbreviation abr">HTML</span> elements are the building 
        blocks of <span class="abbreviation abr">HTML</span> pages. With 
        <span class="abreviation abr">HTML</span>constructs, images and other 
        objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered 
        page. <span class="abbreviation abr">HTML</span> provides a means to
        create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text
        such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. 
        <span class="abbreviation abr">HTML</span> elements are delineated by
        <span class="t">tags</span>, written using angle brackets.Tags such as 
        <span class="tn">&lt;img/&gt;</span> and
        <span class="tn">&lt;input/&gt;</span> 
        directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as 
        <span class="tn">&lt;p&gt; </span>
        surround and provide information about document text and may include 
        other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the 
        <span class ="abbreviation abr">HTML</span> tags, but
            use them to interpret the content of the page.
    </p>

    <h2>Markup</h2>
    <p>
        <span class="abbreviation abr">HTML</span> markup consists of several
        key components, 
        including those called <span class="t">tags</span> (and their 
        <span class="t" >attributes</span>), 
        character-based <span class="t">data types</span>, 
        <span class="t">character references </span> and 
        <span class="t">entity references</span>. 
        <span class="abbreviation abr">HTML</span> tags most commonly come 
        in pairs like <span class="tn">&lt;h1&gt;</span>  and
        <span class="tn">&lt;/h1&gt;</span>, although some represent 
        <span class="t">empty elements</span>  and so are unpaired, for 
        example <span>&lt;img&gt;</span>.The first tag in such a pair is the 
        <span class="t">start tag</span> , and the second is the 
        <span class="t">closing tag</span> (they are also called 
        <span class="t">opening tags </span>and 
        <span class="t">closing tags</span>).
    </p>
            
    <p>
        Another important component is the 
        <span class="abbreviation abr">HTML</span> 
        <span class="t">document type declaration</span>, which triggers 
        standards mode rendering.
    </p>
    <p>
        The following is an example of the classic "Hello, World!" program:
    </p>
        <div class="cod">
            <pre>
                &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
                    &lt;html&gt;
                        &lt;head&gt;
                            &lt;title&gt;<span class="black">This is a title</span>&lt;/title&gt;
                        &lt;/head&gt;
                        &lt;body&gt;
                            &lt;p&gt;<span class="black">Hello world!</span>&lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;/body&gt;
                    &lt;/html&gt;
            </pre>
            </div>
